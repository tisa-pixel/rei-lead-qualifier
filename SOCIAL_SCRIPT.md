## SHORT VERSION (30-60 seconds)

**Hook:**
"I built an AI that makes sales calls for real estate investors — and it took me less than 2 hours."

**Body:**
"Her name is Sarah. She calls leads, qualifies them using tactical empathy techniques, and warm transfers the hot ones directly to your team.

After every call, she updates 10+ fields in Salesforce automatically — motivation, timeline, property condition, call notes — all of it.

The cost? About $65 a month. Compare that to $3-5k for a human SDR.

Built this entire thing with Claude Code in an hour and 45 minutes."

**CTA:**
"Link in bio if you want the code. It's open source."

## MEDIUM VERSION (60-90 seconds)

**Hook:**
"What if you never had to manually qualify another real estate lead again?"

**Body:**
"I built an AI voice agent called Sarah that does it for you.

Here's what she does:
- Calls your leads automatically with a personalized opening
- Uses Chris Voss-style tactical empathy — mirroring, labeling, calibrated questions
- Qualifies based on motivation, timeline, ownership, and agent status
- If qualified, she warm transfers them to your closer immediately
- After the call, Claude interprets the transcript and updates Salesforce — 10+ fields

**The numbers:**
- Build time: 1 hour 45 minutes with Claude Code
- Monthly cost: about $65
- Human SDR: $3-5k per month
- Annual savings: $35-59k

The stack is Retell AI for voice, Claude for the conversation and transcript analysis, Heroku for webhooks, and Salesforce for CRM."

## LONG VERSION (2-3 minutes for YouTube/podcast clips)

**Hook:**
"Real estate investors waste thousands of dollars on lead qualification every year. I fixed that in under 2 hours."

**The Problem:**
"Here's the problem with manual lead qualification. It's expensive — you're paying $3-5k a month for an SDR. It's inconsistent — scripts get ignored, data entry is sloppy. And it's slow — speed-to-lead matters, and humans take breaks."

**The Solution:**
"So I built Sarah. She's an AI voice agent that calls leads, qualifies them, and warm transfers the good ones to your team.

The conversation style uses tactical empathy — that's the Chris Voss negotiation method. She mirrors what people say, labels their emotions, asks calibrated questions, and actually listens. She knows not to say things like 'Is now a good time?' or 'I completely understand' — because those phrases kill deals."

**The Qualification:**
"She qualifies on four criteria:
1. Do they have a motivation to sell — divorce, inheritance, foreclosure, repairs?
2. Is their timeline within 3 months?
3. Are they the owner or co-owner?
4. Are they NOT working with a real estate agent?

If all four are yes, she warm transfers to your closer. If not, she exits gracefully."

**The Tech:**
"After every call, Claude analyzes the transcript and extracts structured data — timeline, motivation, property condition, obstacles, everything. Then it updates Salesforce automatically — Rating, Status, 10+ custom fields, plus a full call activity record with the transcript."

**The ROI:**
"The whole thing runs on:
- Retell AI for the voice — about $50-60/month at 150 calls per week
- Heroku for webhooks — $7/month
- Anthropic API — about $5/month

Total: $65 a month vs $3-5k for a human.

That's $35-59k in annual savings."

**The Build:**
"And here's the kicker — I built this in 1 hour and 45 minutes using Claude Code. Traditional approach would've been 4-6 weeks and $12k+ for a Salesforce admin and developer."

**CTA:**
"I open-sourced the whole project. Link in the description. Go build your own AI SDR."

## LINKEDIN POST VERSION

**Building AI that replaces $60k/year jobs — in under 2 hours.**

Last week I built Sarah, an AI voice agent that qualifies real estate leads.

What she does:
→ Calls leads with personalized intros
→ Qualifies using tactical empathy techniques
→ Warm transfers qualified leads to closers
→ Updates 10+ Salesforce fields automatically
→ Creates call activity records with transcripts

The math:
• Build time: 1.75 hours (with Claude Code)
• Monthly operating cost: ~$65
• Human SDR equivalent: $3-5k/month
• Annual savings: $35-59k

The traditional way to build this? 4-6 weeks and $12k+ in consulting fees.

The stack is simple: Retell AI + Claude + Heroku + Salesforce.

I open-sourced the whole project. Comment "SARAH" and I'll send you the repo.
